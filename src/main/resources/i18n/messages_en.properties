about.first=<span class="first-letter">H</span>ave you ever been to those libraries with paperback editions of books? \
                                Yes, despite the 21st century outdoors, those really exist. And, you know, personally, \
                                I like reading paperback editions very much. Electronic books, tablets and web granted us with \
                                an excellent feature of downloading a ton of books on one small device and be able to read them \
                                everywhere, but, you know, there is a lack of, for example, that nice paper smell \
                                from the pages of the new book. As for me, I also like the process of turning the paper pages and \
                                feeling myself closer to the back cover with every turned page.

about.second=<span class="first-letter">T</span>he style most libraries work is really likely to be much better. \
                                 In a couple words: when you enter the library, you need to stay in a queue and wait, \
                                 while angry librarian is drinking her coffee up to the end, than she registers you \
                                 (another awful procedure, I should say), than you are free to go to a huge hall with numerous \
                                 shelves, where you have to find particular card corresponding to the books you want to take. \
                                 After you make your choice, you need to give that cards to the same angry librarian, who might \
                                 drink another cup of coffee in that very moment :) Than you have to wait a couple hours while \
                                 library staff go to archive and find your order there. Very uncomfortable.
about.third=<span class="first-letter">M</span>y idea is that the whole process can be reduced and be made much more comfortable for users. \
                                Only imagine, you are sitting at home at your computer, choose all your books through the web-site \
                                and receive the QR code, which corresponds to your order. Than you just take your QR to the library, \
                                give it to that very angry librarian and get your books immediately (as they would have some time \
                                to get the books from the archive while you are on your way to the library). Much nicer, isn't it? :)
